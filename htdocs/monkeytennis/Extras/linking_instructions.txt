---------- ADD PROJECT HONEY POT BUTTON TO YOUR WEBSITE ------------

If you want to support Project Honey Pot you can add a button to your website.
The Project Honey Pot website button is included in this folder. Use the linking
code below so you'll get credit for people who sign up for Project Honey Pot
after being referred from your site:

<a href="http://www.projecthoneypot.org?rf=46663">
<img src="{url_of_img}" height="31px" width="88px" 
alt="Stop Spam Harvesters, Join Project Honey Pot"></a>

Replace {url_of_img} with the url pointing the Project Honey Pot button image on
your site.

If you create your own Project Honey Pot button, don't hesitate to send it to us
and we may include it for other sites to install. The more people who
participate in Project Honey Pot, the more effective it will be!
